# Package installation

To run this code you need to install the `grdpg` package from Github.

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("/meleangelo/grdpg")
```

# Examples
The examples in the text are generated with the file

- [simulations.R](simulations.R)

These results are shown in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the paper.

# Monte carlo
**Disclaimer**: if you run the Monte Carlo code for replication, please note that each network simulation generates large matrices and may overwhelm your RAM. In the simulations we use a PC with 64GB RAM, and for the simulations with $n=10000$ we can only use 10 processors. If you use more processors you may run out of memory.


In the Monte Carlo experiments we estimate a model with two binary observed covariates, 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Z}_i \sim Bernoulli(b_z) \ \ \  and \ \ \  \mathbf{W}_i \sim Bernoulli(b_w)
\end{equation}
and vary the probabilities $b_z$ and $b_w$, as well as the correlation among the two variables. We estimate the following model in each Monte Carlo design
\begin{equation}
    \log\left(\frac{P_{ij}}{1-P_{ij}}\right) =\mathbf{X}_i^T \mathbf{X}_j + \beta_1 \mathbf{1}_{\lbrace \mathbf{Z}_i=\mathbf{Z}_j \rbrace} + \beta_2 \mathbf{1}_{\lbrace \mathbf{W}_i=\mathbf{W}_j \rbrace}.
    \label{eq:mc_model}
\end{equation}
The Monte Carlo design considers networks of sizes $n=2000, 5000, 10000$ and we set the number of blocks to $K=2$. For all the simulations the parameter value that generates the data is $\mathbf{\beta} = (0.5,0.75)$ and the centers of the blocks are $\mathbf{\nu}=(-1.5,1.0)$.

The Monte Carlo experiments follow 5 different designs, as shown in the following table



| Design   | $\pi_1$   | $b_z$   | $b_w$   | correlation |
| ----- | ---- | --- | --- | ----- |  
1   | $0.5$  |  $0.5$ | $0.5$ |  independent |
      2   | $0.5$  |  $0.5$ | $0.5$ |  $0.3$ |
      3   | $0.3$  |  $0.5$ | $0.5$ |  independent |
      4   | $0.3$  |  $0.4$ | $0.6$ |  independent |
      5   | $0.3$  |  $0.4$ | $0.6$ |  $0.3$ |

# Variance plug-in estimator
The plug-in estimator for the variance is tested using the code

- [TestingVarianceFormula.R](TestingVarianceFormula.R)

The results are in Table 8.

# Empirical Application to Facebook data
The code for descriptive statistics and estimation is

- [FacebookHarvardLarge.R](FacebookHarvardLarge.R)

and the data are cotained in the Matlab file 

- [Harvard1.mat](Harvard.mat)

The results are in Table 9 and 10 in the paper.
